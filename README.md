# IT Globers test - Juan David Diaz Orozco

Small project carried out for the company It-Globers.

It is an application inspired by a store dedicated to the sale of multipurpose products, at the top you can interact with the photo collage, below this you will find a section where you will preview some products and at the end you will see a newsletter section where you can subscribe to receive the most interesting news about PUFI

To subscribe to the newsletter section you must register a valid email, otherwise an error "Invalid Email" will appear and the submit button will be disabled.

If you enter a valid email a confirmation message will appear and you would already be subscribed to the News Feed.
